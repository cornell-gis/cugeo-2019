# CUGEO 2019

Cornell Geospatial Forum
Thursday, February 14, 2019  
3:00pm to 5:00pm  
Mann Library 102

Please join us for CUGEO, the third nearly-annual Cornell Geospatial Forum, a gathering of faculty, staff, students, and community members to discuss geospatial science and technology research, teaching, and extension at Cornell.

We held the first two CUGEO events in 2014 and 2015.  Since then, several new faculty and many new students and researchers have arrived on campus, so we are long overdue for another event to bring together the geospatial community at Cornell.  (We had scheduled an event in November 2018, but it had to be cancelled due to a snowstorm.)

This event will feature short 5-minute lightning talks from our community.  This is a great opportunity to learn about others who are using geospatial tools, methods, and analyses in their own work.  We all can learn something new from each other.  We hope you will join us!
